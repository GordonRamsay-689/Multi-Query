13 Nov 2024:
-   'session.py' is split into Session(), GeminiClient() and GoogleClient().
-   removed function .get_response() (send_request()) and format_response() from
Session() in favor of uniform function and variable naming for anytyhing that should
be accessible inside the -Client() objects. 
Calling send_request() from main would look like this:
    session.client.send_request()
- Added reset() function to Session(). We may want to add this to the -Client() objects
as well in the future.
-   controller Object HandleQuery() is also in 'master.py'. It is not necessary for 
Session() to function as a library. It exists for the sake of the current project 
implementation. 
We should be able to safely thread HandleQuery() since we terminate the 
object each loop, while keeping Session() and it's -Client() alive.
-   renamed CLIENT_TO_TYPE to CLIENT_ID_TO_TYPE.
