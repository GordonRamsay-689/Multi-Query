- Threading will be handled outside of Session or -Client objects. There is 
no need to add complexity to them when the QueryHandler() or Master are perfectly
capable of taking care of those details.

- Look up best ways to implement a timer for concurrent api calls, the one in 
gemini.py.Master.timer() is most likely stupidly convoluted. Still, handling
all threads from Master makes sense as it will be the one calling them, and 
it avoids individual timer objects for each query.
