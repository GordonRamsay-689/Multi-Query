TESTS THAT MUST BE PERFORMED:

Consider: individual test case for each client-type OR test together?
__ Will differ on test-to-test basis.

api_session.py:

- set_query()
-- Correctly sets query for each possible type

- reset()
-- Correctly resets expected attributes.

- Response Formatting

- Test each possible client
-- No error raised on init
-- Receives response (isinstance(response, str) or for openai, isinstance(response, dict))

- For openai: context properly updated
    - After stream
    - Without stream

request_handler.py:

- Fail to receive response
-- Request removes self from requests.
-- ui.c_out is called.

- API throws error
    - During formatting.
    - During query.
    - During stream.
-- No error messages are propagataed to user.
-- Request removes self from requests.
-- Consider: add handling for specific exceptions to
completely remove the client-session (or even suggest
application restart).
